# SQL_Project
in  this project i analyzed global layoff dataset from  (2020–2025) using SQL. Cleaned, normalized, and deduplicated records, then queried insights to reveal top companies by layoffs and major employment trends.


## How I Ingested the Data
The raw layoff dataset was provided as a CSV file. I imported this file into MySQL to create the project database. Using MySQL Workbench, I loaded the CSV into a new table, ensured correct data types, and ran initial validation checks. This allowed me to build a structured relational database ready for cleaning, normalization, and analysis.
